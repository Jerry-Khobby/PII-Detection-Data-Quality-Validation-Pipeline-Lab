PII DETECTION REPORT
PII Detection & Data Quality Validation Pipeline – Part 2
---
1. RISK CLASSIFICATION

High Sensitivity Data:

* First Name
* Last Name
* Email Address
* Phone Number
* Date of Birth
* Physical Address

Medium Sensitivity Data:

* Income (financial attribute)

---

2. DATASET SUMMARY

Total records analyzed: 10

PII Presence Metrics:

* Email addresses detected: 10 out of 10 (100%)
* Phone numbers detected: 10 out of 10 (100%)
* Full identity exposure (First Name + Last Name + Email): 8 out of 10 (80%)
* Partial identity exposure (missing first or last name): 2 out of 10 (20%)
* Physical addresses present: 9 out of 10 (90%)
* Dates of birth present (including invalid format entries): 10 out of 10 (100%)

3. EXPOSURE RISK ANALYSIS

This dataset presents a high exposure risk profile.

Key Findings:

1. Universal Contact Exposure
   100% of records contain email addresses and phone numbers.
   This enables direct phishing attacks and SMS-based social engineering.

2. High Identity Linkage
   80% of records contain full identity linkage (first name + last name + email).
   These individuals are at elevated risk of identity misuse.

3. Sensitive Attribute Combination
   The coexistence of full name, email, phone number, date of birth, and physical address significantly increases risk severity.

4. Potential Attack Scenarios

   * Targeted phishing campaigns
   * SIM swap attacks
   * Credential reset abuse
   * Account takeover attempts
   * Identity spoofing and fraud

Because multiple direct identifiers exist within a single table, the dataset would be classified as high impact under most data protection standards.

4. OVERALL RISK RATING

HIGH RISK DATASET

Justification:

* 100% contact information exposure
* 80% full identity linkage
* Presence of multiple strong identifiers in the same record
* No masking, encryption, or tokenization applied

5. MITIGATION RECOMMENDATIONS

6. Mask email addresses before analytics usage
   Example: [john.doe@gmail.com](mailto:john.doe@gmail.com) → j***@gmail.com

7. Tokenize or partially mask phone numbers
   Example: 555-123-4567 → 555-***-4567

8. Hash or encrypt dates of birth at rest

9. Remove direct identifiers from analytical datasets

10. Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

11. Separate PII from behavioral or financial attributes (data minimization principle)
