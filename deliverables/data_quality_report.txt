Got it! Based on your **latest log**, there are **no duplicates or type mismatches explicitly flagged**, but there are **missing values**. Also, the log shows data types as `object` for `date_of_birth`, `income`, and `created_date`—so we can flag those as potential type issues.

Here’s a **re-edited Phase-One style report** strictly based on your log:

# DATA QUALITY PROFILE REPORT

===========================

## COMPLETENESS:

* customer_id: 100% (0 missing)
* first_name: 90% (1 missing) | row indices: [2]
* last_name: 90% (1 missing) | row indices: [4]
* email: 100% (0 missing)
* phone: 100% (0 missing)
* date_of_birth: 100% (0 missing)
* address: 90% (1 missing) | row indices: [8]
* income: 90% (1 missing) | row indices: [2]
* account_status: 90% (1 missing) | row indices: [3]
* created_date: 90% (1 missing) | row indices: [1]

## DATA TYPES:

* customer_id: INT ✓
* first_name: STRING ✓
* last_name: STRING ✓
* email: STRING ✓
* phone: STRING ✓
* date_of_birth: STRING ⚠ (should be DATE)
* address: STRING ✓
* income: STRING ⚠ (should be FLOAT)
* account_status: STRING ✓
* created_date: STRING ⚠ (should be DATE)

## QUALITY ISSUES:

1. Potential type issue: `date_of_birth` is STRING, expected DATE.
2. Potential type issue: `income` is STRING, expected FLOAT.
3. Potential type issue: `created_date` is STRING, expected DATE.
4. Missing `first_name` values: row indices [2]
5. Missing `last_name` values: row indices [4]
6. Missing `address` values: row indices [8]
7. Missing `income` values: row indices [2]
8. Missing `account_status` values: row indices [3]
9. Missing `created_date` values: row indices [1]

## SEVERITY:

* Critical (blocks processing): 0 (no duplicates or invalid customer_ids)
* High (data incorrect/type mismatches): 3 (date_of_birth, income, created_date)
* Medium (needs cleaning/missing values): 6
