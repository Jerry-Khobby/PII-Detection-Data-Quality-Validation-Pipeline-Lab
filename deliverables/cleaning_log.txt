# DATA CLEANING LOG

====================

## ACTIONS TAKEN:

**Cleaning Strategy Update:**

* Only `customer_id` is treated as a critical field.
* All other missing fields are filled with safe placeholder/default values.
* Objective: Maximize data retention while preserving primary key integrity.

**Deletion Policy:**

* `customer_id`: Rows missing or invalid removed.
* Result: 0 rows deleted.

**Normalization:**

* Trimmed whitespace from column names and string values.
* Converted `first_name` and `last_name` to Title Case (excluding placeholder "Unknown").
* Standardized phone numbers to XXX-XXX-XXXX format.
* Converted all dates to YYYY-MM-DD format.
* Converted `customer_id` to integer.
* Converted `income` to float.

**Missing Value Handling (Filled with Placeholders):**

* `first_name` → "Unknown"
* `last_name` → "Unknown"
* `email` → [noemail@placeholder.com](mailto:noemail@placeholder.com)
* `phone` → 000-000-0000
* `address` → Address Not Provided
* `income` → 0.0
* `account_status` → inactive
* `date_of_birth` → 1900-01-01
* `created_date` → Current system date

**Rationale:**

* `customer_id` is the only true primary key.
* All other attributes can be updated later.
* Improves dataset completeness and downstream usability.

## VALIDATION RESULTS

**Before Cleaning:**

* Total rows: 10
* Passed validation: 4
* Failed validation: 6
* Failed row indices: 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9

Major issues identified:

* Invalid numeric income values
* Invalid `account_status` values
* Incorrect date formats
* Missing required values
* Address length violations

**After Cleaning:**

* Initial rows: 10
* Deleted (missing `customer_id`): 0
* Successfully cleaned: 9
* Failed validation: 1

**Remaining Validation Failure:**

Row index: 1
Customer ID: 2

Issues:

* Address too short ("95000") — fails length requirement (10–200 characters)
* `account_status` contains invalid value ("2024-01-11")

Reason: These values are structurally invalid and do not match business validation rules. They were not auto-corrected to avoid masking incorrect data.
